Wendlerizer
===========

Class and functions to allow me to mass-generate Wendler 531 training programs, with flexible assistance work.

I love Jim Wendler's 531 program, and I have just grown to appreciate it the longer I do it. In an attempt
to help spread the love, I wrote this quick and kind of crappy class to help me crank out the numbers for
members of the barbell club, mostly just because it's a lot cooler than using a spreadsheet (see unicorn.txt).

TrainingProgram.py is the actual class.
ExampleProgram.py is an example of putting it to use.
